##INSTALLING SSL In LINUX SERVER / APACHE WEBSERVER

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, the protocol which provides the encryption. SSL Certificates provide secure, encrypted communications between a website and an internet browser. SSL Certificates are typically installed on pages that require end-users to submit sensitive information over the internet like credit card details or passwords. SSL certificate used to secure our web site and web app.

Steps to install SSL Certificate on Linux(Ubuntu/Debian) Apache Web Server.
Step1: Install OpenSSL on Linux
OpenSSL is a software library to be used in applications that need to secure communication over the internet.
To install on Ubuntu/Debian run the following command
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install openssl

Step2: Generate Key and CSR for certificate request
CSR stands for Certificate Signing request, To generate server key file run the following command, replace example.com to your domain name on which you want to install ssl certificate.
       openssl genrsa -out example.com.key 2048
Generate CSR file you may run the following command
      openssl req -new -sha256 -key example.com.key -out example.com.csr
When you will run the above command it will ask your information like
Country: IN  
State / Province: XYZ
City: XYZ
Department:XYZ
Organization: XYZ
Common Name: www.example.com

*Fill your details and hit enter, In Country provide two digit of your country code(example India: IN, USA: US etc ) 

Download these two file(example.com.key and example.com.csr) and submit submit it to certificate provider, Than they will issue certificate.
The certificate should contains two file .crt and .ca-bundle or bundle.crt
Put your certificate file, bundle file and key file in the directory /etc/ssl/certs/
SSLCertificateFile  --- Certificate file
SSLCertificateKeyFile --- Server key file
SSLCertificateChainFile --- bundle file

step3: Configuration of Certificate in Apache web server
Add the virtual host in apache
sudo nano /etc/apache2/site-enabled/000-default.conf
virtual host like

＜VirtualHost *:443＞
         ServerAdmin admin@example.com
         DocumentRoot /var/www/html
         ServerName example.com
          ServerAlias www.example.com
         SSLEngine on
         SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/example.com.crt
         SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/certs/example.com.key
         SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/example_bundle.crt
         ＜Directory /var/www/html＞
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride All
        ＜/Directory＞
＜/VirtualHost＞


#Redirect all http traffic to https

＜VirtualHost *:80＞
      ServerName example.com
      ServerAlias www.example.com
      Redirect permanent / https://www.example.com
＜/VirtualHost＞

Now enable SSL Mode in apache
       sudo a2enmod ssl
Restart apache services
       sudo service apache2 restart

Step4: Test
Open your website URL in web browser eg. example.com or www.example.com
